***The VBA of Wall Street***

#### This VBA script will analyze real stock market data by looping through all the stocks for each year and output the following information:
<ul>
<li>The ticker symbol</li>
<li>Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year</li>
<li>The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year</li>
<li>The total stock volume of the stock</li>
</ul>

The solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

The attached files are screenshots for each year (2014, 2015, 2015 and the separate VBA script named, "WallStreetVBAcode". The data files used to run this script are located [here](https://columbia.bootcampcontent.com/columbia-bootcamp/cu-nyc-data-pt-11-2020-u-c/tree/master/02-Homework/02-VBA-Scripting/Instructions/Resources) for reference.
